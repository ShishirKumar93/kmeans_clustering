K-means Clustering with kmeans++ centroid initialisation technique

Here, we implement K-means Clustering algorithm from scratch. kmeans++ centroid initialisation technique has also been implemented from scratch. We then use these algorithms to compress images.

Thanks to Prof. [Terence Parr](https://github.com/parrt) for his guidance and support in this school project.
