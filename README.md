K-means Clustering with kmeans++ centroid initialization technique

Here, I implement K-means Clustering algorithm along with the kmeans++ centroid initialization technique from scratch. Furthermore, I use it to compress images.

Thanks to Prof. [Terence Parr](https://github.com/parrt) for his guidance and support in this school project.
